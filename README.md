## Final Project Requirements: Demystifying ML

### Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing:
  Analyzing NBA data (teams and games) to predict the winner of the NBA Finals, by using machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned such as SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tableau. We are also using Scikit-learn as our ML library. 
  
### Rationale
  The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association. The Eastern and Western Conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion. With the growing popularity of sports betting, we wanted to create a simulator that will predict the winner of the NBA Finals taking place in June so that potential sports bettors can place their bets with the help of a data model.

### Project 4 Group Work

  The requirements for this project are broken into 5 categories:
   * Data and data delivery via Python and Pandas
   * Back end (ETL) via SQL
   * Visualizations via Tableau
   * Group presentations by all team members
   * Slide deck via Powerpoint

## Step 1 - Data Delivery via Python and Back End via SQL
  We connected to the NBA_API.Stats and pulled the team metics data for seasons from 2017 to 2022. We then averaged the team metrics for overall measures and exported as a CSV and into SQL to apply to the model.

## Step 2 - Build Function to Analyze Data
 Function needs to run through provided data easily and with reasonable success.
