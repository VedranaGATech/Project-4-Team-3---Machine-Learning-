Final Project Requirements: Demystifying ML

Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing:
Analyzing NBA data (teams and games) to predict the winner of the NBA Finals, by using machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned such as SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tableau. We are also using Scikit-learn as our ML library. 
Rationale
The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association. The Eastern and Western Conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion. With the growing popularity of sports betting, we wanted to create a simulator that will predict the winner of the NBA Finals taking place in June so that potential sports bettors can place their bets with the help of a data model.
